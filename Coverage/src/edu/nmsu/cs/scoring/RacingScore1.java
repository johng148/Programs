 * Olympic Dragon Racing Scoring Class
 *
 * For the Summer Olympics dragon racing event there are three judges, each of which gives a score
 * from 0 to 50 (inclusive), but the lowest score is thrown out and the competitor's overall score
 * is just the sum of the two highest scores. This class supports the recording of the three judge's
 * scores, and the computing of the competitor's overall score.
